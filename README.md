# twenty4

This was my first attempt to get into some form of programming. 
Obviously, it tanked, I gave up, and it's been sitting untouched ever since. 
I'll leave it up here just to remind myself that it takes a few tries to get 
something to stick.

Now stop wasting your time and go look at something useful.
